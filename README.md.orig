**Note:** The webstie is down so I cloned the repo here. The images
are also hosted on [mega.nz].

## Support

You can support new pictures by purchasing a shirt or hoodie with one
of the prints. The previews and links are available at
**[linux.pictures]** website. but we really don't mind if you download
the high resolutions image from this repo and make a sticker, poster
or shirt yourself.

## License

All images are distributed under idgaf license. It means that you can
use provided designs for any noncommercial purposes like creation of
handout materials for conferences and meet-ups, printing wall posters
for home and office and so on, but if you violate the license we will
most probably do nothing, because we don't give a fuck.
